# EduBlocks Next (v4)

## What is this reposistory?

As EduBlocks has grown over the years, it has evolved from a small program running on the Raspberry Pi to a web app for creating python programs. EduBlocks has followed a path of putting features out as quickly as possible, often meaning less time to refactor.

EduBlocks Next (v4) is an attempt to rewrite the EduBlocks codebase using new technologies, offering a faster, more intuitive user experience.

The program is now using Vue 3 instead of React as a frontend framework and is written in Typescript.
